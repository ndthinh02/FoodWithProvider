          'Zongzi is a Chinese traditional food for the Dragon Boat Festival. The glutinous rice is wrapped into reed leaves and then steamed. Zongzi appeared in the Spring and Autumn Period (770 - 476 BC), and was used for the worship of ancestors and Gods. Starting from Warring States Period (475 - 221 BC), it was used to commemorate the great poet Qu Yuan. In the Jin Dynasty (265 - 420 AD), it was fixed as the festival food for Dragon Boat Festival, and Chinese medicine, meat, chestnuts and other things were added as fillings except for glutinous rice. During the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 AD), preserved fruits were added into fillings of Zongzi. Later, more and more spicy Zongzis came out. Nowadays, the common fillings of sweet Zongzi are red bean, red date, rose, date paste, bean paste, etc.; while those of salty ones are pork, ham, sausages, shrimp, etc.',

          'Tofu, or bean curd, is a traditional bean product that is mostly made of soybeans, black beans or other beans with a high protein content. Most people believe that tofu was invented in about 164 BC during the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC - 9 AD) by Liu An, the seignior in Huainan, Anhui. However, its taste was not as good as the current tofu, so it was not widely used as a cooking ingredient. In the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD), tofu was taken to Japan. Until the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 AD), the method of making tofu was greatly improved and tofu became an important daily Chinese food. In the meantime, tofu was introduced into Korea. Later, it came to Europe, Africa and North America in the early 19th century. Nowadays, tofu has became an important food not only in China, but also in Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and other neighboring countries.',
